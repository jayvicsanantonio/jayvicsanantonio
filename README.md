# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jayvic San Antonio

Fullâ€‘stack web engineer building typed, tested web systems on React/Next.js and Cloudflare Workers/Hono. I care about clean boundaries (Zod at the edges), useful CI (that blocks regressions), and small UX details that make products feel polished. Recently focused on practical AI agents and developerâ€‘first automation.

## What Iâ€™m Known For

- Typed serverless APIs paired with modern React frontends.
- Engineering hygiene: strict TypeScript, Zod validation, and meaningful tests.
- Practical AI: structured outputs with guardrails; maintainable, not just demos.
- Developer automation: scheduled Actions, PR bots, coverage gates, perf budgets.

## Engineering Practices

- Strict TypeScript across repos; Zod at trust boundaries.
- Tests with Vitest/Jest + Testing Library; coverage enforced where it matters.
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions: typeâ€‘check, lint, test, deploy; scheduled automations; performance budgets.
- Edge/serverless patterns: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge; D1/SQLite, Upstash/Redis; PWA for offline UX.
