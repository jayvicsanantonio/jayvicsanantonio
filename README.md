I am Jayvic San Antonio, and I am a full stack web developer from the Philippines, now building in the San Francisco Bay Area. For more than a decade, I have shipped products across hackathons, a startup I co founded, and a global media and tech company. JavaScript has been my constant companion through it all, from crafting friendly, fast UIs in React and Next.js, to designing reliable, typed APIs with Node and Cloudflare Workers.

Lately, my curiosity has been focused on AI. I experiment with agents and workflow or repo analysis, and I always add guardrails. I use typed schemas and structured outputs, so results are trustworthy. I wire tests into CI, and treat reliability as a feature. Small experiments turn into maintainable systems that real teams can build on.

Tools I use every day include JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Prisma, Knex, SQLite, Upstash Redis, Zod, Vitest, Jest, Testing Library, ESLint, Biome, GitHub Actions, OpenAI, LangChain, Clerk, Miniflare, Wrangler, React Native, Expo, Babylon.js, Radix UI, Framer Motion, SWR, Axios, Tailwind Merge, Lighthouse CI, and more. I keep my skills sharp, and I stay close to the latest tech, so I can choose the right tool with confidence.

I care about craft and people. I value clear, readable code, thoughtful UX, and collaborative, inclusive teams. If you want someone who learns fast, stays current, and can take a product from idea to shipped, while sweating details and performance, I would love to connect.

You can reach me at codes@jayvicsanantonio.dev, and you can see more of my work at https://jayvicsanantonio.dev. When I am not coding, I am herding cats, getting steps in Pok√©mon Go, and brewing late night coffee.
